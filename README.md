## Background
Cursor Custodian is a simple endless platformer where you use your cursor to guide the player away from obstacles. The player moves away from your cursor and will jump if you click the left mouse button near him. More information on how to play is available on the game's [itch.io page](https://polymars.itch.io/cursor-custodian).

## Compiling
### Windows
After installing [Mingw64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z/download), [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), [SDL_TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/), and [SDL_Mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/), execute the following command in the project's root directory:
```
g++ -c src/*.cpp -std=c++14 -O3 -Wall -m64 -I include -I C:/SDL2-w64/include && g++ *.o -o bin/release/main -s -L C:/SDL2-w64/lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer && start bin/release/main
```
The compiled ``.exe`` is located in ``./bin``. For it to run, you must copy the ``./res`` folder as well as all ``.dll`` files from your SDL installation to its directory.
### Linux
After installing the dev packages of SDL2 for your distribution, execute the following command in the project's root directory:
```
g++ -c src/*.cpp -std=c++14 -O3 -Wall -m64 -I include && mkdir -p bin/release && g++ *.o -o bin/release/main -s -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer
```
The compiled binary ``main`` is located in ``./bin``. For it to run, you must copy the ``./res`` folder to its directory.

### Web
Install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) and execute the following command in the project's root directory:
```
emcc src/main.cpp src/entity.cpp src/renderwindow.cpp src/player.cpp src/ground.cpp src/groundtile.cpp -I include -O2 -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s \"SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS=['png']\" -s USE_SDL_TTF=2 -s USE_SDL_MIXER=2 --preload-file res -o index.html
```

You can also just run `make web` to achieve the same compilation.

The compiled ``.js``, ``.wasm``, ``.data``, and ``.html`` files are located in the project's root.

You can use `python` to run a server on localhost port 8000 like so:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to run the game in the browser.
